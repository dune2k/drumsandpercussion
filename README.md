In this repo you find a GM SFZ file for the Salamander Drumkit. http://rytmenpinne.posterous.com/pages/salamander-drumkit
I use it with Impro-Visor

There is also a SFZ file for Salamander Drumkit + Percussion. 

Place the SFZ files in the root folder of the Salamander Drumkit
Place the ogg and Samples folder in the root folder of the Salamander Drumkit
